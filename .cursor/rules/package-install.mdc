# Package install

- Always use pnpm for package installations
- Avoid directly editing package.json for new deps
- We use pnpm workspaces, so install package in appropriate app / lib with --filter
  - Syntax `pnpm i --filter [PROJECT_NAME_FROM_PACKAGE.JSON] [PACKAGE_NAME]`
  - Example for installing `@zag-js/checkbox` into project `ui` is following `pnpm i --filter ui @zag-js/checkbox`
- We use Nx to share logic and separate it
- Never call "npm", always call with pnpm
